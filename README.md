------

Synth is a tool for generating realistic looking and anonymized synthetic data. Synth is database agnostic and can scale to millions of rows of data.

The key features of Synth are:
- **Synthetic Data as Code**: Data generation is described using a configuration language allowing you to specify your entire data model as code. Synthetic data as code enables you to peer review, version control and automate your synthetic data generation.
 
- **Data Inference**: Synth can ingest data from your primary data source and infer the structure of the data. Understanding the relationships, distributions and types of the underlying dataset.

- **Database Agnostic**: Synth supports semi-structured data and is database agnostic - playing nicely with SQL and NoSQL databases. 
 
- **Semantic Data Types**: Synth integrates with the (amazing) Python [Faker](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/) library, supporting generation of thousands of semantic types (e.g. credit card numbers, email addresses etc.) as well as locales.

## Installation & Getting Started

To get started quickly, check out the [docs](https://openquery-io.github.io/synth/installation)

## Why Rust

We decided to build Synth from the ground up in Rust. We love Rust, and given the scale of data we wanted `synth` to generate, it made sense as a first choice. The combination of memory safety, performance, expressiveness and a great community made it a no-brainer and we've never looked back!

## Get in touch

If you would like to learn more, or you would like support for your use-case, feel free to open an issue on Github.

If your query is more sensitive, you can email [opensource@getsynth.com](mailto:opensource@getsynth.com) and we'll happily chat about your usecase.

If you intend on using Synth, we would recommend joining our growing [Discord](https://discord.gg/wwJVAFKKkq) community.
