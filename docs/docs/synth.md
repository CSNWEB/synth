**Synth** is a fast and versatile NoSQL synthetic data engine for
semi-structured data.

With **Synth** you can:

* **Anonymize** sensitive data for use in the development and testing of
  applications and machine learning models.
* **Augment** your existing data with look-alike synthetic data to help you
  develop your application at scale.
* **Create** new fake or dummy data with user-specified sets of
  constraints, bounds and relations.
  
## Concepts

This section covers the architecture of Synth, how it works under the hood, and it's features and capabilities.

Synth uses some novel ideas, so we would recommend starting with the [core concepts](core-concepts.md).


## Get Started

This section explains how to [easily get started with Synth](hello-world.md).

To see examples of Synth in action, see the [examples](examples/bank.md) section.
